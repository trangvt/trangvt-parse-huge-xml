		<d104>BRITISH ENGLISH, A TO ZED is the thoroughly updated, revised, and
		expanded third edition of Norman Schur’s highly acclaimed transatlantic
		dictionary for English speakers. First published as BRITISH SELF-TAUGHT and
		then as ENGLISH ENGLISH, this collection of Briticisms for Americans, and
		Americanisms for the British, is a scholarly yet witty lexicon, combining
		definitions with commentary on the most frequently used and some lesser
		known words and phrases. Highly readable, it’s a snip of a book, and one
		that sorts out – through comments in American – the “Queen’s English” –
		confounding as it may seem.</d104>

		<d104>Norman Schur is without doubt the outstanding authority on the
		similarities and differences between British and American English. BRITISH
		ENGLISH, A TO ZED attests not only to his expertise, but also to his
		undiminished powers to inform, amuse and entertain. – Laurence Urdang,
		Editor, VERBATIM, The Language Quarterly, Spring 1988</d104>
